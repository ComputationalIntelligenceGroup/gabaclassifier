load the data set
combine the classifiers
try with more data. that would require neurostr and my code on more cells.
if you combine the classifiers, you may good results. just apply some useful ones.


// I can import the classifiers and models directly from source files.
// Code:
    learning and models. get this by source, probably will not be reused
    mlr: this is OK to be exported elsewhere, e.g., to mlearn. can be tested as well
